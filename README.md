# BlackJack

## 2 players against the dealer to get closest to 21 wins

This project is an example that was derived from CodePal of how to implement a BlackJack game in C++. This project is sample code which was modified and shows how to do the following:

* Create seperate classes for player, card, deck, and game
* Implement Modularization
* Separate interface from implementation
  
## Modify this project for your own use
